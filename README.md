# st7-quantum-computing-labs

## Description

This project brings together all the labs carried out during the **Quantum Computing** course at CentraleSup√©lec.

## Labs

Here is an overview of the different labs:
- *Lab1*: Introduction to quantum computing. Qiskit module and basic circuits: **Classic registers**, **Quantums registers**, **basic gates**.
- *Lab2*: Implementation of two famous algorithms: **Grover algorithm** and **QPE algorithm** (Quantum Phase Estimation).
- *Lab3*: Simulation and execution of circuits: **perfect simulation**, **noisy simulation** and **IBM execution**.
- *Lab4*: Variational Quantum Algorithms: introduction of **parametrized circuits** and optimization.
- *Lab5*: Quantum Machine Learning: **embedding** circuit, **fidelity** circuit and similarity matrix for **clustering**.

## Quick start

First, setup the env with:

````
make setup
make install
````

Then you can run each lab with:
```
make run_lab_1
make run_lab_2
make run_lab_3
make run_lab_4
make run_lab_5
```
