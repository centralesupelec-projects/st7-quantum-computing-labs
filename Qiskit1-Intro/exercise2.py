## Exercice 2

# 1 - Implement the "bogus" circuit and double-check what we discussed
# You will need to generate an entangled state as above!
# 2. Now, implement the "correct" version and check that
# the ancilla wire is separated from the other registers.
# Note: In QisKit, Toffoli gates are .ccx()
